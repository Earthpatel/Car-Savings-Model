This project models the financial timeline for a young professional aiming to purchase a new car with cash. The model accounts for various financial factors, including inflation on car prices, the depreciation of the current trade-in vehicle, existing savings, and regular monthly contributions to a savings fund.


Key Features:
Inflation Modeling: Simulates the rising price of a new car over time due to inflation.
Depreciation of Trade-In Vehicle: Accounts for the decreasing value of the trade-in car as it depreciates monthly.
Savings Growth: Incorporates both initial savings and regular monthly savings contributions to determine when the user can afford the car.
Dynamic Time Frame: Calculates the number of months required for the total savings (including the trade-in value) to meet or exceed the inflated price of the new car.
